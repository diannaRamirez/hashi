## 2.11.0 (Unreleased)

DEPENDENCIES: 

* updating `github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go` to `v42.1.0` [GH-6725]
* updating `network` to `2020-03-01` [GH-6727]

FEATURES:
* **Opt-In/Experimental Enhanced Validation for Locations:** This allows validating that the `location` field being specified is a valid Azure Region within the Azure Environment being used - which can be caught via `terraform plan` rather than `terraform apply`. This can be enabled by setting the Environment Variable `ARM_PROVIDER_ENHANCED_VALIDATION` to `true` and will be enabled by default in a future release of the AzureRM Provider [GH-6927]

IMPROVEMENTS:

* `azurerm_api_management_api_version_set` - updating the validation for the `name` field [GH-6947]
* `azurerm_app_service` - the `ip_restriction` block now supports the `action` property [GH-6967]
* `azurerm_databricks_workspace` - exposing `workspace_id` and `workspace_url` [GH-6973]
* `azurerm_storage_account` - allowing the value `PATCH` for `allowed_methods` within the `cors_rule` block within the `blob_properties` block [GH-6964]

BUG FIXES:

* `azurerm_api_management_subscription` - fix the export of `primary_key` and `secondary_key` [GH-6938]
