# azurerm_ad_application

Create a new application in Azure Active Directory. If your account is not an administrator in Active Directory an administrator must enable users to register applications within the User Settings. In addition, if you are using a Service Principal then it must have the following permissions under the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API:

* Read and write all applications
* Sign in and read user profile

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_ad_application" "example" {
  display_name = "example"
}
```

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_ad_application" "example" {
  display_name = "example"
  homepage = "http://homepage"
  identifier_uris = ["http://uri"]
  reply_urls = ["http://replyurl"]
  available_to_other_tenants = false
  oauth2_allow_implicit_flow = true
}
```

## Example Usage with Key Credential Certificate Authentication

```hcl
resource "tls_private_key" "example" {
  algorithm   = "ECDSA"
  ecdsa_curve = "P384"
}

resource "tls_self_signed_cert" "example" {
  key_algorithm   = "${tls_private_key.example.algorithm}"
  private_key_pem = "${tls_private_key.example.private_key_pem}"

  subject {
    common_name  = "example.com"
    organization = "ACME Examples, Inc"
  }

  validity_period_hours = 12

  allowed_uses = [
    "key_encipherment",
    "digital_signature",
    "server_auth",
    "cert_signing",
  ]
}

resource "azurerm_ad_application" "example" {
  display_name = "example"

  key_credential {
    key_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    type = "AsymmetricX509Cert"
    usage = "Verify"
    value = "${tls_self_signed_cert.example.cert_pem}"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage with Password Credential Authentication

```hcl
resource "azurerm_ad_application" "test" {
  display_name = "example"

  password_credential {
    key_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    value = "example"
    start_date = "2018-03-01T00:00:00+00:00"
    end_date = "2018-03-02T00:00:00+00:00"
  }
}
```

`key_credential` supports the following:

* `key_id` - (Required) The unique identifier (GUID) for the key.

* `type` - (Required) The type of key credential. Possible values are `AsymmetricX509Cert` and `Symmetric`.

* `usage` - (Required) A string that describes the purpose for which the key can be used. Possible values are `Sign` and `Verify`.

* `start_date` - (Required) The date and time at which the credential becomes valid.

* `end_date` - (Required) The date and time at which the credential expires.

* `value` - (Required) The certificate value of the credential.

`password_credential` supports the following:

* `start_date` - (Required) The date and time at which the credential becomes valid.

* `end_date` - (Required) The date and time at which the credential expires.

* `value` - (Required) The secret value of the credential.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `app_id` - The Application ID.

* `object_id` - The Application Object ID.

## Import

Azure Active Directory Applications can be imported using the `object id`, e.g.
