provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_avs_private_cloud" "example" {
  name                = "example-avs-private-cloud"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  sku_name            = "av36"

  management_cluster {
    size = 3
  }

  network_subnet              = "192.168.48.0/22"
  internet_connection_enabled = false
  nsxt_password               = "QazWsx13$Edc"
  vcenter_password            = "QazWsx13$Edc"
  tags = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
}
```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Azure Vmware Solution Private Cloud. Changing this forces a new Azure Vmware Solution Private Cloud to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Azure Vmware Solution Private Cloud should exist. Changing this forces a new Azure Vmware Solution Private Cloud to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The Azure Region where the Azure Vmware Solution Private Cloud should exist. Changing this forces a new Azure Vmware Solution Private Cloud to be created.

* `management_cluster` - (Required) A `management_cluster` block as defined below.

* `network_subnet` - (Required) The subnet which should be unique across virtual network in your subscription as well as on-premise. Changing this forces a new Azure Vmware Solution Private Cloud to be created.

* `sku_name` - (Required) The Name of the SKU used for this Private Cloud. Changing this forces a new Azure Vmware Solution Private Cloud to be created. Possible values are `av20`, `av36` and `av36t`.

* `internet_connection_enabled` - (Optional) Is the Private CLuster connected to the internet?

* `nsxt_password` - (Optional) The password of the NSX-T Manager. Changing this forces a new Azure Vmware Solution Private Cloud to be created.
