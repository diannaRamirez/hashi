# azurerm_iot_security_solution

Manages an iot security solution.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_iothub" "example" {
  name                = "example-IoTHub"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  sku {
    name     = "S1"
    capacity = "1"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_iot_security_solution" "example" {
  name                = "example-Iot-Security-Solution"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  display_name        = "Iot Security Solution"
  iothub_ids          = [azurerm_iothub.example.id]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Iot Security Solution. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the resource group in which to create the Iot Security Solution. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
