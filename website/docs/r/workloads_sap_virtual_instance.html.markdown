# azurerm_workloads_sap_virtual_instance

Manages a SAP Virtual Instance.

-> **Note:** Before using this resource, it's required to submit the request of registering the Resource Provider with Azure CLI `az provider register --namespace "Microsoft.Workloads"`. The Resource Provider can take a while to register, you can check the status by running `az provider show --namespace "Microsoft.Workloads" --query "registrationState"`. Once this outputs "Registered" the Resource Provider is available for use.

* `location` - (Required) The Azure Region where the SAP Virtual Instance should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `environment` - (Required) The environment type for the SAP Virtual Instance. Possible values are `NonProd` and `Prod`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `os_sap_configuration` - (Required) An `os_sap_configuration` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `single_server_configuration` - (Optional) A `single_server_configuration` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `three_tier_configuration` - (Optional) A `three_tier_configuration` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

---

An `os_sap_configuration` block supports the following:

* `sap_fqdn` - (Required) The FQDN of the SAP system. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `deployer_vm_packages` - (Optional) A `deployer_vm_packages` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

---

A `deployer_vm_packages` block supports the following:

* `storage_account_id` - (Required) A `deployer_vm_packages` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **Note:** While creating SAP Virtual Instance, service would provision the extra SAP system/component in `app_resource_group_name` which aren't defined in tf config. At this time, when `app_resource_group_name` is different with the Resource Group where SAP Virtual Instance exists, we can set `prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources` to `false` to delete all resources defined in tf config and the resources created in `app_resource_group_name` with `tf destroy`. But when `app_resource_group_name` is same with the Resource Group where SAP Virtual Instance exists, some resources like the subnet defined in tf config cannot be deleted with `tf destroy` since the resources defined in tf config are being referenced by the SAP system/component created in `app_resource_group_name`. So it has to manually delete the resources in `app_resource_group_name` first after the SAP Virtual Instance is deleted, and then the resources in tf config can be deleted successfully for this situation.
