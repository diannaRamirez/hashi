## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Image Builder Template. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the Image Builder Template should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The Azure Region where the Image Builder Template should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `identity` - (Required) An `identity` block as defined below.

---

* `build_timeout_minutes` - (Optional) Maximum duration to wait while building the image template. Defaults to `240`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `customizer` - (Optional) A `customizer` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **Note** Azure Image Builder will run through the customizers in sequential order. Any failure in any customizer will fail the build process.

* `disk_size_gb` - (Optional) Size of the OS disk in GB. Defaults to 0 to leave the same size as the source image. You can only increase the size of the OS Disk (Win and Linux) but cannot reduce the OS Disk size to smaller than the size from the source image. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `distribution_managed_image` - (Optional) A `distribution_managed_image` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `distribution_shared_image` - (Optional) A `distribution_shared_image` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `distribution_vhd` - (Optional) A `distribution_vhd` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE** At least one of `distribution_managed_image`, `distribution_shared_image` and `distribution_vhd` is required to specify.

* `size` - (Optional) Size of the virtual machine used to build, customize and capture images. Defaults to `Standard_D1_v2`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `source_managed_image_id` - (Optional) The ID of an image source that is a managed image. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `source_platform_image` - (Optional) A `source_platform_image` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `source_shared_image_version_id` - (Optional) The ID of an image source that is an image version in a shared image gallery. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `subnet_id` - (Optional) The ID of the subnet that the virtual machine used to build, customize and capture images. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **Note** If you specify a VNET, Azure Image Builder does not use a public IP address. Communication from Azure Image Builder Service to the build VM uses Azure Private Link technology. Private Link service requires an IP from the given VNET and subnet. Currently, Azure doesnâ€™t support Network Policies on these IPs. Hence, network policies need to be disabled on the subnet, to do which, you need to ensure `enforce_private_link_service_network_policies` is set to `true` in your `azurerm_subnet` resource.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---
